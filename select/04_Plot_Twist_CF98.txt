I will never be somebody
Everybody likes
It's out of reach
It doesn't matter what I do
It doesn't matter what I do
Did I really say it
Or it's your friends
Talked to your friends
Talked to me?
Story short you lied
Story short you lied
So why do I even try?
You'll be always a villain
In someone else's mind
You'll be always a bad girl
Ten versions of the same story
And you'll be bad in one
Don't you try to be perfect
Do you know another plot twist
Trying so hard, helping out someone
Ending as a guilty side
Surprise!
You'll be always a villain
In someone else's mind
You'll be always a bad guy
Ten versions of the same story
And you'll be bad in one
Don't you try to be perfect
Cause nothing's perfect!
