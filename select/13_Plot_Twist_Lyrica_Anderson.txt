And I left quite quickly
Didn't even know what had hit me
Didn't know what hit me
Now I'm over here empty
Dying 'cause I never been without ya
Now I know it's others out here
Don't give up, that's what mama taught me
Don't got much left for me to give you, honey

Plot twist, you push me in the arms of someone, oh-ooh
Playing Russian roulette with the wrong gun, oh-ooh

Is it too late for love, for us, for ya?
Is it too late for love, for us, for ya?
Is it too late? Is it too late? Is it too late?
Is it too late? Is it too late? Is it too late?
Is it too late? Is it too late? Is it too late?

Got my tank sitting on еmpty
What the hell I let get in me?
To make me come back into the fire
He ain't even got no money
He can't even do as much for me
He occupied my lonely
Now I know that's where I should be

Plot twist, you push me in the arms of someone, oh-ooh
Playing Russian roulette with the wrong gun
Now I'm asking him

Is it too late for love, for us, for ya?
Is it too late for love, for us, for ya?
Is it too late? Is it too late? Is it too late?
Is it too late? Is it too late? Is it too late?
Is it too late? Is it too late? Is it too late?

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, too late, too late
Oh, oh, oh, oh
