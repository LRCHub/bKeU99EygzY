Oh no, no ooh woah
Oh no, oh no, oh no
(Woah, Kenny)

I'm known to fuck things up, I fall in love too fast
I fall out twice as hard, I don't want to
Think of all things that could go wrong with so much
Goin' on this long, but I want you
And there's so many things I wanna say, but pride gets in my way
I hate that about me
But you seem really nice, that's why I'm gonna try to not ruin your life, how's that sound B?

Ooh (Cool)
I'm about to lose my cool (To lose my cool)
The thing I said I'd never do (I'd never do, no)
So don't you play me for a fool (Don't you play me for a fool)

I don't believe it, this can't be real
I don't like it, Jesus take the wheel
A lot of other guys, wanna tap this
'Cause they already know, I'm a bad bitch
Can't believe it, I caught the feels (Oh no)
And I don't like it, this was not the deal
A lot of other guys, wanna love this (They wanna love this)
But here I am with you, what a plot twist

I don't usually fall for what I see (No, oh)
But you look like James Dean, think I like it
It caught me by surprise (True), ain't usually my vibe
You pull it off so nice, I think I like it (I think I like it)
But don't get it twisted or misunderstood
If a bitch would, I'm fightin'
I hate it when you try to play the nice guy, hold your tongue or I'm bitin'

Ooh (Cool)
I'm about to lose my cool (To lose my cool)
The thing I said I'd never do (I'd never do, no)
So don't you play me for a fool (Don't you play me for a fool)

I don't believe it, this can't be real
I don't like it, Jesus take the wheel
A lot of other guys, wanna tap this
'Cause they already know, I'm a bad bitch
Can't believe it, I caught the feels (Oh no)
And I don't like it, this was not the deal
A lot of other guys, wanna love this (They wanna love this)
But here I am with you, what a plot twist

Ooh
A lot of other guys, wanna love this
But here I am with you, what a plot twist
Ooh
(Not the deal)
